 * `getRandomQuote` function - Here I've created a function which uses Math.random to return a random quote from the 'quotes' array between index 0-4.
    Since arrays start at an index value of zero, I did not need to set a minimum value since there's a chance the random number will be rounded down to
    zero by using Math.floor which is what I want for the first quote to display.

//*** Here i've created a function which creates a random HEX value and assigns that value to the color variable.
//*** The color variable is concatinated with both the randomHex variable string (1-F) which is futher manipulated by...
//*** using the Math.random function within a for loop to randomly choose those hex values.
//*** the function then changes the body background color. (I added another event listened line at the bottom of the code to call this function each time the button is clicked.)

/***
 * `printQuote` function - This function I created calls the getRandomQuote function above and then assigns the quote to a variable named quoteObject.
    Using template literals (because I find them way easier to work with) I started constructing my HTML and inserted the quote using the quoteObject variable...
    and specifically targeted the properties that were relevant for each section of the string.
    Furthermore, I created two IF statements to run in the event there was also a citation or year property associated with the object.
    I was thinking of using (xx ||(or)&&(and) xx) statement, however I wasn't sure if this would work as well so I kept things simple.

  let quoteObject = getRandomQuote();

    if (quoteObject.year) {
